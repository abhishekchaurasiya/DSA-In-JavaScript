//what is time complexity and why we need it ?
//time taken by the code or algorithm or function

//how to calculate the time complexity

var a = 1;  //(c) constant time taken by the statement
var b = 2;  //(c) constant time taken by the statement

var c = a + b;  // c (addition) + c (assignment) => 2c

//total time taken by the code to execute or complete is (c+c+2c) => 4C

var arr = [] // time complexity (c) constant time

// we need to calculate total even number in array

arr = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 20, 22] //(8c)

//even number divided by 2

let even_count = 0 //c
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {  //c
        even_count++  //2c
        let h = 23; // c
        let i = 23;  // c
        let sum = h + i; // 2c
    }
}


// total = c + loop(c + 2c + c + c + 2c) 

//total time complexity => c + loop(c + 2c) => c + loop(3c) => c + no. of time loop runs(in our case arr.length) * 3c => c + 8 * 3c => 25c

//array size of n => c + n*2c => c + 2nc => c(2n + 1)
console.log(even_count)

var x = 3; // one constaint time (c)
var y = 4; // one constaint time (c)
var z = x + y;  // two constaint time(2c)
